    "### Assignment objective\n",
    "This assignment aims to provide the necessary practices for learning the principles of deep learning programing in NLP using PyTorch. To this end, Task A provides the space for becoming fully familiar with PyTorch programming by implementing a \"simple\" document (sentence) classification model with PyTorch, and Task B extends this classifier with a BERT model. As the assignment requires working with PyTorch and Huggingface Transformers, please familiarize yourself with these libraries using any possible available teaching resources in particular the libraries' documentations. The assignment has in total **40 points**, and also offers **2 extra points** which can cover any missing point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook encompasses all aspects of the assignment, namely the descriptions of tasks as well as your solutions and reports. Feel free to add any required cell for solutions. The cells can contain code, reports, charts, tables, or any other material, required for the assignment. Feel free to provide the solutions in an interactive and visual way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Please discuss any unclear point in the assignment in the provided forum in MOODLE. It is also encouraged to provide answers to your peer's questions. However when submitting a post, keep in mind to avoid providing solutions. Please let the tutor(s) know shall you find any error or unclarity in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation & Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment should be implemented with recent versions of `Python`, `PyTorch` and, `transformers`. Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`. Examples of potentially useful libraries are `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `AllenNLP`. Use the latest stable version of each library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group submits one Notebook file (`.ipynb`) through MOODLE. Do not forget to put in your names and student numbers in the first cell of the Notebook. **In the submitted Notebook, all the results and visualizations should already be present, and can be observed simply by loading the Notebook in a browser.** The Notebook must be self-contained, meaning that one can run all the cells from top to bottom without any error. If you need to include extra files in the submission, compress all files (together with the Notebook) in a `zip` file and submit the zip file to MOODLE. You do not need to include the data files in the submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cover the questions/points, mentioned in the tasks, but also add any necessary point for understanding your experiments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct the experiments, two datasets are provided. The datasets are taken from the data of `thedeep` project, produced by the DEEP (https://www.thedeep.io) platform. The DEEP is an open-source platform, which aims to facilitate processing of textual data for international humanitarian response organizations. The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset has 12 classes (labels) like agriculture, health, and protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the datasets is in their sizes. We refer to these as `medium` and `small`, containing an overall number of 38,000 and 12,000 annotated text excerpts, respectively. Select one of the datasets, and use it for all of the tasks. `medium` provides more data and therefore reflects a more realistic scenario. `small` is however provided for the sake of convenience, particularly if running the experiments on your available hardware takes too long. Using `medium` is generally recommended, but from the point of view of assignment grading, there is no difference between the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.jku.at/filr/public-link/file-download/0cce88f07c9c862b017c9cfba294077a/33590/5792942781153185740/nlp2021_22_data.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether `medium` or `small`, you will find the following files in the provided zip file:\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.train.txt`: Train set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.validation.txt`: Validation set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.test.txt`: Test set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.label.txt`: Captions of the labels.\n",
    "- `README.txt`: Terms of use of the dataset.\n",

    "The aim of this task is identical to the one of Assignment 2 - Task B, namely to design a document classification model that exploits pre-trained word embeddings. It is of course allowed to use the preprocessed text, the dictionary, or any other relevant code or processings, done in the previous assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you implement a document classification model using PyTorch, which given a document/sentence (consisting of a set of words) predicts the corresponding class. Before getting started with coding, have a look at the optional <a href=\"#section-tensorboard\">Task C</a>, as you may want to already include `Tensorboard` in the code. The implementation of the classifier should cover the points below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preprocessing and dictionary (1 point):** Following previous assignments, load the train, validation, and test datasets, apply necessary preprocessing steps, and create a dictionary of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data batching (4 points):** Using the dictionary, create batches for any given dataset (train/validation/test). Each batch is a two-dimensional matrix of *batch-size* to *max-document-length*, containing the IDs of the words in the corresponding documents. *Batch-size* and *max-document-length* are two hyper-parameters and can be set to any appropriate values (*Batch-size* must be higher than 1 and *max-document-length* at least 50 words). If a document has more than *max-document-length* words, only the first *max-document-length* words should be kept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word embedding lookup (2 point):** Using `torch.nn.Embedding`, create a lookup for the embeddings of all the words in the dictionary. The lookup is in fact a matrix, which maps the ID of each word to the corresponding word vector. Similar to Assignment 2, use the pre-trained vectors of a word embedding model (like word2vec or GloVe) to initialize the word embeddings of the lookup. Keep in mind that the embeddings of the words in the lookup should be matched with the correct vector in the pretrained word embedding. If the vector of a word in the lookup does not exist in the pretrained word embeddings, the corresponding vector should be initialized randomly. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model definition (3 points):** Define the class `ClassificationAverageModel` as a PyTorch model. In the initialization procedure, the model receives the word embedding lookup, and includes it in the model as model's parameters. These embeddings parameters should be trainable, meaning that the word vectors get updated during model training. Feel free to add any other parameters to the model, which might be necessary for accomplishing the functionalities explained in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forward function (5 points):** The forward function of the model receives a batch of data, and first fetches the corresponding embeddings of the word IDs in the batch using the lookup. Similar to Assignment 2, the embedding of a document is created by calculating the *element-wise mean* of the embeddings of the document's words. Formally, given the document $d$, consisting of words $\\left[ v_1, v_2, ..., v_{|d|} \\right]$, the document representation $\\mathbf{e}_d$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><div>$\\mathbf{e}_d = \\frac{1}{|d|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|d|}{\\mathbf{e}_{v_i}}$</div></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{e}_{v}$ is the vector of the word $v$, and $|d|$ is the length of the document. An important point in the implementation of this formula is that the documents in the batch might have different lengths and therefore each document should be divided by its corresponding $|d|$. Finally, this document embedding is utilized to predict the probability of the output classes, done by applying a linear transformation from the embeddings size to the number of classes, followed by Softmax. The linear transformation also belongs to the model's parameters and will be learned in training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loss Function and optimization (2 point):** The loss between the predicted and the actual classes is calculated using Negative Log Likelihood or Cross Entropy. Update the model's parameters using any appropriate optimization mechanism such as Adam.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Early Stopping (2 points):** After each epoch, evaluate the model on the *validation set* using accuracy. If the evaluation result (accuracy) improves, save the model as the best performing one so far. If the results are not improving after a certain number of evaluation rounds (set as another hyper-parameter) or if training reaches a certain number of epochs, terminate the training procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Set Evaluation (1 points):** After finishing the training, load the (already stored) best performing model, and use it for class prediction on the test set. Evaluate and report the final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall functionality of the training procedure (5 point).**\n",

In the Southeastern regions, this proportion is more important (34%) than in the South (24%); which can be explained by the numerous emergency interventions carried out since the end of 2015. Household food consumption in the South-East and the mostly stricken districts for the projected situation would deteriorate compared with the current period. All parameters related to availability, access, use and food stability put together, based on the situation before harvest from the main season will lead to that situation. Even after harvest, one could expect an increase of percentage of households with poor and borderline food consumption score. In the South, we should expect a slight improvement of the situation compared to 2016 although it will remain fragile. \n",

There are currently 8 IDP sites and reception centres in north-western Syria that are supported by the UN and its partners, with additional sites being prepared. Hundreds of tents are also being provided to those in need. However, the capacity of partners to respond to the ongoing displacement is being stretched to the limits. There are particular concerns over reports of increased shortages of essential commodities such as food and medicine, and a marked increase in fuel prices. ? Airstrikes on Idleb struck the last functioning hospital in the south-eastern strip of the rebel enclave. The Syria Relief and Development (SRD)’s hospital in Hass, Idleb was completely destroyed by 5 aerial bombs. The hospital has served hundreds-of-thousands of Syrians in the area. Each month, over 6,000 patients received medical care and over 400 surgeries were performed at the hospital. ? Due to recent hostilities, 19 EPI centres (out of more than 70) in Idleb and Aleppo governorate stopped their activities (eight centres have since resumed their operations, four centres were relocated and seven centres in Maarrat-An-Numan, Sanjar, Tamanaah, Dana, Abul Thohur, Saraqeb districts are still non-functional). ? In Afrin, the ongoing military operations, the reported blockage of exits, have virtually trapped many civilians preventing them from accessing safer areas. So far, 380 families have reached surrounding villages and Aleppo city neighbourhoods while thousands of people have been displaced within Afrin.

      "Marawi residents have started returning to their homes after the 'liberation' of the southern city by the Philippine army. The country's security forces officially ended their combat operations in the city earlier this month. The five-month battle between the army and the 'Islamic State'-linked Maute militant group was one of the deadliest wars in the Southeast Asian country since World War Two. But the initial joy of city's 'liberation' is gradually being replaced by frustration and anger as details of the troops' alleged rights violations and destruction of the area come to the fore.Many residents, who had fled the city after Islamists took over Marawi in May, had only seen the devastation on mainstream and social media. Now as they return to their city, they find it has been reduced to rubble.Some residents are now preparing to take legal action against the government, accusing authorities of mass destruction of property, illegal detention and extra-judicial killings. Thousands of homes in Marawi have been completely destroyed and it may take years to rebuild them'Since June, we have been documenting reports of civilians who were captured and tortured by the military because they were thought to be Maute fighters. There are reports of illegal detention, extra-judicial killings and numerous other cases of threats and intimidation at evacuation centers and military checkpoints,' Lidasan told DW, adding that many residents were afraid to speak out against the military since it still controls Mindanao.\n",

      "Iraq has detained or imprisoned at least 19,000 people accused of connections to the ISIS or other terror-related offenses, and sentenced more than 3,000 of them to death, according to an analysis by The Associated Press. The mass incarceration and speed of guilty verdicts raise concerns over potential miscarriages of justice — and worries that jailed militants are recruiting within the general prison population to build new extremist networks.The AP count is based partially on an analysis of a spreadsheet listing all 27,849 people imprisoned in Iraq as of late January, provided by an official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Thousands more also are believed to be held in detention by other bodies, including the Federal Police, military intelligence and Kurdish forces. Those exact figures could not be immediately obtained.  The AP determined that 8,861 of the prisoners listed in the spreadsheet were convicted of terrorism-related charges since the beginning of 2013 — arrests overwhelmingly likely to be linked to the ISIS, according to an intelligence figure in Baghdad.  In addition, another 11,000 people currently are being detained by the intelligence branch of the Interior Ministry, undergoing interrogation or awaiting trial, a second intelligence official said. Both intelligence officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the press.uman Rights Watch warned in November that the broad use of terrorism laws meant those with minimal connections to the ISIS are caught up in prosecutions alongside those behind the worst abuses. The group estimated a similar number of detainees and prisoners — about 20,000 in all. \n",

Before exploding his explosive vest, he tried to hurl a hand grenade from the door step of a classroom but the grenade went off in his hand and killed him,' said Hussain Ali Sultanfar, a teacher at the school. 'When the students heard the sound of the explosion, everyone ran away, and some of the students got injured escaping the scene. This was one of our special classes with 600 students in class,' Ali added.  Although no group has accepted responsibility for the attack, three months ago the Islamic State group claimed responsibility of an attack on a Shia cultural and religious school some five kilometers away from yesterday's attack.  'Whoever these are, they can't stop us from learning and promoting education in the county, however should attacks such as this continue, parents may withdraw their children from our famous education center,' Ali said.  International Humanitarian Law forbids attacks on educational institutions by armed groups or military forces. Educational facilities must be protected in armed conflict in the same way as healthcare facilities. \n",
