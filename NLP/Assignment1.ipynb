    "### Assignment objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this assignment is to implement a document (sentence) classification model using (standard) machine learning methods. The assignment in total has **30 points**; it also offers **2 extra points** which can cover any missing point.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook encompasses all aspects of the assignment, namely the descriptions of tasks as well as your solutions and reports. Feel free to add any required cell for solutions. The cells can contain code, reports, charts, tables, or any other material, required for the assignment. Feel free to provide the solutions in an interactive and visual way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Please discuss any unclear point in the assignment in the provided forum in MOODLE. It is also encouraged to provide answers to your peer's questions. However when submitting a post, keep in mind to avoid providing solutions. Please let the tutor(s) know shall you find any error or unclarity in the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation & Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment should be implemented with recent versions of `Python` (>3.7). Any standard Python library can be used, so far that the library is free and can be simply installed using `pip` or `conda`. Examples of potentially useful libraries are `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `gensim`, `nltk`, `spaCy`, and `AllenNLP`. Use the latest stable version of each library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "Each group submits one Notebook file (`.ipynb`) trough MOODLE. Do not forget to put in your names and student numbers in the first cell of the Notebook. **In the submitted Notebook, all the results and visualizations should already be present, and can be observed simply by loading the Notebook in a browser.** The Notebook must be self-contained, meaning that one can run all the cells from top to bottom without any error. If you need to include extra files in the submission, compress all files (together with the Notebook) in a `zip` file and submit the zip file to MOODLE. You do not need to include the data files in the submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cover the questions/points, mentioned in the tasks, but also add any necessary point for understanding your experiments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To conduct the experiments, two datasets are provided. The datasets are taken from the data of `thedeep` project, produced by the DEEP (https://www.thedeep.io) platform. The DEEP is an open-source platform, which aims to facilitate processing of textual data for international humanitarian response organizations. The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes. The provided dataset has 12 classes (labels) like agriculture, health, and protection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the datasets is in their sizes. We refer to these as `medium` and `small`, containing an overall number of 38,000 and 12,000 annotated text excerpts, respectively. Select one of the datasets, and use it for all of the tasks. `medium` provides more data and therefore reflects a more realistic scenario. `small` is however provided for the sake of convenience, particularly if running the experiments on your available hardware takes too long. Using `medium` is generally recommended, but from the point of view of assignment grading, there is no difference between the datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the dataset from [this link](https://drive.jku.at/filr/public-link/file-download/0cce88f07c9c862b017c9cfba294077a/33590/5792942781153185740/nlp2021_22_data.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether `medium` or `small`, you will find the following files in the provided zip file:\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.train.txt`: Train set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.validation.txt`: Validation set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.test.txt`: Test set in csv format with three fields: sentence_id, text, and label.\n",
    "- `thedeep.$name$.label.txt`: Captions of the labels.\n",

Punctuations marks, numbers, dates, case-sensitivity are some examples of the elements which can be potentially considered for cleaning/preprocessing.

Next, reduce the size of dictionary using a method of your choice, for instance by considering a cut-off threshold on the tokens with low frequencies. When removing tokens from the dictionary, consider a strategy for handling Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) tokens, namely the ones in the train/validation/test datasets that that are not anymore in the dictionary. Some possible strategies could be to remove OOVs completely from the texts, or to replace them with a special token like <OOV\\>. Explain your approaches and report the statistics of the dictionary before and after the reduction.\n",

Both variations follow a Bag-of-Words approach with a different token weighting method. The applied weightings can be any of the methods discussed in the lecture (namely `tc`, `tf`, and `tf-idf`), or other possible methods of your choice. Report the applied approaches. Calculate and report the sparsity rate of the vectors of train, validation, and test sets, namely what percentages of the vectors in each set are filled with zeros.\n",
